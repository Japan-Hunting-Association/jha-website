We are pleased to inform you that GeekBeer Co., Ltd. was officially registered as a corporation on January 10, 2024.

Based in Numazu, a gathering place for many breweries, our company aims to focus on product development centered around low-alcohol beverages, which are still relatively rare in Japan.

The corporate registration is just the beginning for us. We intend to introduce various products to the market in the future.

We would appreciate your warm support and encouragement as we embark on this journey.
